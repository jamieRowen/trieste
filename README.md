## Extra materials for the CODATA visualisation course in Trieste

The course handout is available as a pdf. In addition there are a couple of R scripts made available based on other things that we talked about towards the end of the session.

The solutions to the course practicals are included as package vignettes:

`vignette("solutions3", package = "nclRggplot2")`

Remember that there was also a vignette for some of the extra topics such as more advanced plot layouts:

`vignette("extra", package = "nclRggplot2")`

Some of the websites that I mentioned during the course that I think are useful:

* awesome-r.com - A collection of good R packages broken up by subject area
* htmlwidgets.org - Other packages that allow nice interactive graphics, these are great for putting onto some html document or presentation
* flowingdata.com - Inspiration for neat visualisations

Below is a list of some other websites that I think you might find interesting

* http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ - Beautiful graphics created in R
* showmeshiny.com - Not something we had time to talk about in the session, but shiny is a way to create web content that allows client-server interaction with R data. It is a great way for sharing visualisation and analysis with others who no nothing about coding etc
* http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ - Has some tutorials for learning Rmarkdown which is fantastic for creating documents and presentations that have your R code in them directly. This is quite neat for reproducible research ideas and making sure that your created analyses are up to date with the data.
